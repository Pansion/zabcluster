zabcluster
==========

A c++ implementation of multi-master cluster based on ZAB(zookeeper) and Redis.

## Introduction
I have inerests in Paxos/Zab which were used to keep data consistent. 
Then I found Apache Zookeeper which was successul and popular in the area. 
Since I am not a expert on Java, I searched for a similar implmentation in C or C++ but failed. 
Actually zabcluster was a kind of C++ version of Apache Zookeeper.
It provide same feature as leader election/zab/HA of zookeeper. 

Difference:

* much less threads. 
Zookeeper have bunch of threads for election/request handling. 

e.g. If you have N nodes, there will be 2*(N-1) threads in each node which were only used for election. 

During my tests, I can only run ~17 instance of zookeeper in a single host(alright, my desktop was really old and slow).

But for zabcluster, I can run 55 instances in same machine.

* support redis client.
* support redis server as storage.
* support much more clients.
  
##Dependency
Of course, redis-server should be placed in your host.
redis

Thanks for below great open-source projects which make me a lot easier to finish all the work in a month.
To build zabcluster, below libraries will be needed.
  
libevent 2.0 
http://libevent.org/ 
   
log4cplus (1.0.4.1)
http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/

## Build
update Makefile.inc with your own libevent/log4cplus path
* LEV_DIR=/opt/libevent-2.0.19-stable
* LOGCPP_DIR=/opt/log4cplus-1.0.4.1

$ make all
  
NOTE:
* I am really not good at creating autoconf stuffs. In current version, you could only do "make all;make clean"
* I do not have a lot of machines to test different OS. The code was tested only in CentOS 5(32bit) and CentOS 6(64bit).
  
## How to use
I have provided two scripts gen_con.pl and multi_nodes.sh which could make you easier to run zabcluster in a single host

e.g create a 3 nodes cluster running in a host

generate configuration of 3 nodes cluster(include redis configuration)

$ gen_conf.pl 3 
  
launch 3 instances using configuration generated above

$ multi_nodes.sh 3
  
After all intances were started up, you can play with them by using redis-benchmark or any other redis client.
  
Sample output by using redis-benchmark:

[pansion@pansion src]$ ./redis-benchmark -p 2182 -n 100 -t set

1063.83 requests per second
    
## Performance
In my desktop(yes, old and slow), running 3 instances(zabcluster and redis-server) at same time, 
"set" could reach 6~8k with latency 20~30ms, "get" could reach 30k with latency ~5ms.
  
If you have better environment for performance testing, please share results with me.
  
## Known issues
* Do not support PING_INLINE of redis-benchmark
* If redis-server was shutdown, zabcluster will not quit while it will also not process any new request
I am still investgating solution to handle this case.
* No automatic sync between leader/follower. 
If a node failed and want to re-join cluster, you should first use redis "sync" command to get latest data from leader redis-server.

## Todo
* add automatic sync between leader/follower
* redis was a server. make redis a storage of zabcluster required additonal efforts to handle network connection.
A embedded database like leveldb or bdb may be a better choice for the storage of zabcluster. 
I am considering add leveldb support in later time.
  
Any other request are welcome.
